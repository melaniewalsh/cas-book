Our approach was to individually explore and clean the aforementioned columns utilizing the text and numerical operation functions in Python programming language for this purpose mostly. We looked at the dataset holistically at first, identifying features that allowed us to generate meaningful stories or visualizations. Upon confirmation of the features list, we analyzed each of them in detail to document bad data and eliminate them if possible, modify data types, exclude them from the final visualizations if found to be invalid, etc"
