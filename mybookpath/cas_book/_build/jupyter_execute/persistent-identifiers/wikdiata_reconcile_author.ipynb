For example you may have a list of names and a couple of other data points like a university they attended or what country they are from. While Wikidata is not a bibliographic centric system there is a lot of data and works in the ecosystem. In this tutorial we are going to use Wikidata to reconcile names and try to get associated work titles.\n",
